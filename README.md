# Fractal Experiments

This is just me messing around with fractals in the least-appropriate-for-the-job language possible.

Some misc goals:
- See if I can produce a mandelbrot renderer so simple that'll fit on an index card and still be reasonably easy to follow.
- Use AWS lambda to render fractals in parallel
- Maybe make some sort of simple fractal explainer to help people get into this.
